RIDR is a team of researchers who work on foundational problems within machine learning, and apply our expertise on problems related to climate change and ecology.

**Olof Mogren, PhD, group leader**

<img style="float: left; width: 10em; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="/images/people/mogren.png" />

Defended his PhD in computer science at Chalmers University of Technology in 2018
with the thesis [Representation Learning for Natural Language](https://mogren.one/phd/).
Senior researcher, head of the DL group, and responsible for deep learning research at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden.

Olof develops and investigates machine learning based solutions to problems related to the environment and climate change. This includes stream flow forecasting, soundscape analysis for biodiversity monitoring, and AI for circular business models.
