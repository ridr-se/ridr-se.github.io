**Olof Mogren, PhD**

Defended his PhD in computer science at Chalmers University of Technology in 2018.
Senior researcher and head of deep learning research at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden.

In my research, I develop and investigate machine learning based solutions to problems related to the environment and climate change. This includes stream flow forecasting, soundscape analysis for biodiversity monitoring, and AI for circular business models.
